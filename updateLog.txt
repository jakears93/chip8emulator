version 0.2
	-Fixed ADD_VxVy to accurately set V[F] flag
	-Fixed Rom load to read file as binary
	-Added program to create rom files (no error checking)
	-Added getopt loop to set framerate, window size and instruction step mode via cmd args
	-Moved loading of rom to cpu init
	-Editted makefile so object files are created and stored in directory objs

version 0.3
	-Fixed bug that caused V[x] to compare to kk instead of being set to it
	-Fixed bug that cause sprites to be drawn flipped.  While setting pixelOn, shift (7-x) bits right instead of x bits
	-Implemented keyboard inputs
	-Changed standard framerate from 60 to 1000 as 60 produced a very slow game
	-Changed makefile so that if option DF=1 is used, Debug flag is set and opcodes are printed during execution.
	-Fixed cpu function that loads values from I into V0-Vx.  Was causing bug in pong where right player score would not be drawn
	-Put input event and draw screen loops into seperate threads to increase performance
	-Fixed SHL_Vx function as it was always evaluating as false
	-Initialized each SDL component seperately and safely close them at program exit.
	-Created new makefile with -Ofast flags to cut down size of built program and boost performance
	-Can now be run by setting makefile option DF=1, allowing for debug statements to be printed to console during execution
	-Reorganized code
